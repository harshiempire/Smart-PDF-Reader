The re-\nceptors in the skin, the so called cutaneous receptors, tell\nus about temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure and sur-\nface texture (mechano receptors), and pain (nociceptors).\nThe receptors in muscles and joints provide information\nabout muscle length, muscle tension, and joint angles.\n\nCutaneous receptors\n\nSensory information from Meissner corpuscles and rapidly\nadapting afferents leads to adjustment of grip force when\nobjects are lifted. These afferents respond with a brief\nburst of action potentials when objects move a small dis-\ntance during the early stages of lifting.

Such\na rapid response to a tactile stimulus is a clear indication\nof the role played by somatosensory neurons in motor ac-\ntivity.\n\nThe slowly adapting Merkel\u2019s receptors are responsible\nfor form and texture perception. As would be expected for\nreceptors mediating form perception, Merkel\u2019s receptors\nare present at high density in the digits and around the\nmouth (50/mm\u00b2 of skin surface), at lower density in oth-\ner glabrous surfaces, and at very low density in hairy skin.\nThis innervations density shrinks progressively with the\npassage of time so that by the age of 50, the density in hu-\nman digits is reduced to 10/mm\u00b2. Unlike rapidly adapting\naxons, slowly adapting fibers respond not only to the ini-\ntial indentation of skin, but also to sustained indentation\nup to several seconds in duration.\n\nActivation of the rapidly adapting Pacinian corpuscles\ngives a feeling of vibration, while the slowly adapting\nRuffini corpuscles respond to the lataral movement or\nstretching of skin.\n\nNociceptors\n\nNociceptors have free nerve endings.

The rapidly transmit-\nted signal, which often has high spatial resolution, is\ncalled first pain or cutaneous pricking pain. It is well local-\nized and easily tolerated.

They are quite simple in principle, consisting of a few\nsmall muscle fibers with a capsule surrounding the middle\nthird of the fibers.
